## üìù Overview
Gen AI 4 Burma is a web app that enables users to apply various AI-powered transformations to their images, such as restoration, recoloring, generative fill, object removal, and background removal. Users can also explore other users‚Äô transformations, search for images by content, and purchase credits for using the app. The app aims to support the Burma Spring Revolution, a popular uprising against the military coup that took place in Myanmar on February 1, 2021. The people of Myanmar are demanding the restoration of democracy, the release of political prisoners, and the recognition of their ethnic and cultural diversity. By using the app, users can show their solidarity and support for the cause, learn more about the history and culture of Myanmar, and donate to humanitarian aid channels that are providing assistance to the people of Myanmar. Gen AI 4 Burma is more than just an image transformer, it is a platform for social change and justice.
